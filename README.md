# Glassdoor-Salary-Prediction

A salary predictor is created using the job listings from an employment website, in this case, Glassdoor.com. A data mining technique is used to generate a model which will scrape the number of jobs from the employment website, clean it on the basis of a number of factors including the rival companies, revenue, and skill required thereby predicting the salary to be expected when applying for a job. Techniques like linear regression, lasso regression, random forest regressors are optimized using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.  Another variation of modeling is applying the NN, RNN, and GRU on JD to predict the salary. The model can be further extended to build a fast API thus can be deployed on the internet for public usage.
